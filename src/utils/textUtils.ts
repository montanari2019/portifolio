I am a technology and innovation enthusiast, with extensive experience in software development and data analysis, focusing mainly on systems development.

Between 2018 and 2021, I studied Systems Analysis and Development at IFRO in Vilhena, Rondônia. During this period, I focused my efforts on web languages ​​such as JavaScript and became familiar with Vue.js, React.js and Node.js. I highlight the creation of an innovative TCC project, a management system for an association of academics. Users could join online, with administrators having full control, including issuing invoices integrated with the Sicoob bank API. This allowed me to graduate with honors and explore AWS for infrastructure.

After graduation, I started my career as a Systems Developer. Contributed to IFRO in developing a front-end in React.js with Material-UI for a portfolio of projects, implementing an authentication layer with React Context.

I also improved my skills through courses focused on JavaScript at Rocketseat, creating applications with attractive and responsive interfaces, adopting the best market practices.
At Rede de Postos Miran, with the M-Park project, I developed the front-end in React.js and the back-end with NestJS. This included responsive graphics, design patterns, session control and integration with Totvs.

Currently, I work in project development at Sicoob Credisul, where I focus my efforts on creating innovative and effective solutions that meet the organization's needs. I continue to improve my skills and knowledge, staying at the forefront of systems development.

With a solid foundation in systems development, I am always excited to face new challenges and contribute to the success of projects in the world of technology.

    describe: `In 2024, I had the opportunity, as a freelancer, to develop the multiplatform mobile application Sicoob Agrotech, used on April 4th, 5th and 6th, 2024.

The application had several functionalities, such as geolocation of exhibitors throughout the fair, reading of QR code to count scores, social login, notifications, sale of exhibitors' products and listing of available lectures, all with a locator to make it easier for visitors to find your destination correctly. We use NestJS for the backend, React Native for the mobile app, and NextJS for the administration frontend. We also integrate several services such as high scalability, which at one point during the fair had eleven thousand simultaneous accesses, CI/CD, Docker and Azure Blob Storage. It was one of the most incredible projects I participated in, as I was completely at the forefront of its implementation, and Igor was also a fundamental pillar in its creation.

This project is available in my personal portfolio.`,

    describe: `At Sicoob Credisul we start by collaborating with all areas of the company during the ideation phase to understand their needs. We then develop intuitive interface prototypes, validate requirements, structure systems for scalability and efficiency, and ensure effective database creation and management. These steps are crucial to meeting organizational and user expectations.

I lead projects such as “Corporate Performance”, where we use ETL principles to extract financial data and integrate with IBM Cognos to collect information, ensuring security through Azure Active Directory. We also implemented a data entry tool in Excel with rigorous validations.

I also created the "Voyager" project, much larger and more challenging than Corporate Performance, in which we used the same principle but to analyze data from our clients.

These projects are owned by sicoob credisul so they are not listed in my portfolio, but it can be seen by accessing my github.`,

    describe: `At Miran Station Network, I had a lot of experience being involved in the project known as M-park. This project aimed to improve truck parking control at stations that were close to goods movement locations. 
    
    My work covered the front-end, using React.js to create a friendly interface, graphics and a design pattern that improved the user experience, I integrated session control features, ensuring the security and fluidity of the application. In the back-end with Nestjs, I focused on user authentication, database rules and integration with Protheus from the company Totvs, fundamental for the system's efficiency, as through it we collect data for insertion into our application, making this service more improved and more efficient database queries.
    
    One of the system's most impressive features is its ability to monitor the entry and exit of trucks at the yard. It provides detailed information about the time elapsed since the trucks arrived, the number of invoices received for unloading at the ports and the expected departure times for all trucks. All of this is presented in a graphic, detailed, analytical and concise way, making monitoring and decision-making more effective.
    
    Furthermore, the system offers user control, allowing registration and changing passwords via email, making the account management process simple and secure. We also integrated features such as Google reCAPTCHA and Google Analytics to monitor platform usability, which was key to improving user experience and operational efficiency.,
    
    Participating in this project from start to finish was an enriching experience, facing technical challenges and contributing to the M-PARK company. I'm proud to have played a vital role in creating this valuable tool. It was a unique opportunity for learning and growth.`,
